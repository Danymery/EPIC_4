    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Meta Llama 3, a powerful library for querying tables of data to extract insights. We'll go through each step and explain every line of code in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Importing the Library\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import the Meta Llama 3 library into our Python environment. This allows us to use the functions and classes provided by the library.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",

    "\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Defining the Query\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Running the Query\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you've learned how to use Meta Llama 3 to load a data table, define a query, run it, and display the results. This process can be applied to various data analysis tasks to extract meaningful insights from your data."
